Skye: You'll pass out wearing that in the sun
Yoru: I don't need your advice
[Later on] Maybe she was right
[Next day] 
Letter from Skye: Dear Farmboy, Try this! :) - Skye
Thought: Not bad...

Maybe flower bouquet?
Skye: Thanks...though. Y'know, you're pretty cute with a blush like that. riftwalker

VIPER - CHAMBER
viper has a fling with chamber and so that's where the purple shorts go: viper's bedroom

chamber does not flirt during this period because he is deathly afraid of viper doing something about it before he can get someone to yoink it (they're really comfy, sue him) 

this does not stop him from flirting with viper after it is recovered, however, because he likes to tempt fate

chamber normally: ah! my dearest farmer friend, yoru! might i tempt you with some sweet deals~? perhaps offer you a lovely rose- you may have to grow it yourself, but it's the thought that counts, yes?
chamber while viper has leverage: ʸᵒʳᵘ. ᶦ ᵐᵘˢᵗ ᵃˢᵏ ᵃ ᵐᵒˢᵗ ᵉᵐᵇᵃʳʳᵃˢˢᶦⁿᵍ ᶠᵃᵛᵒᵘʳ ᵒᶠ ʸᵒᵘ.



ASTRA
astra is just like aaand HERE is my scrying bowl! check it out aren't the stars cool? yes i know it's not night time now, that's irrelevant to what i'm scrying (the stars). 
Now since you want to See the spirits better, you can like, chug some of this scrying liquid. that makes sense, right?
it's totally safe i changed it yesterday and haven't scried anything weird with it (yet).



RAZE
n then raze can run the carpentry + radio show with segments about carpentry and robotics, with killjoy and kayo sometimes making guest appearances
when shes building stuff for you kj subs in and plays lo fi hip hop beats to solder to all day


SOVA
maybe sova rotates between the docks and the lake tent

keepin an eye on the wildlife and not homeless, just cba to build a whole other building
posts fish and forage quests on the board, like a 'hey help me take a census of the local wildlife stuff. 
if you can catch 3 fish within 2 day then the population is probably ok. also show me so i can check the fish for artificial influences. 
a little birdie told me mirror chamber was skulking around the river yesterday and i don't trust him not to dump junk in there.'




wouldnt it be funny if chamber and mirror chamber spend half their time sending passive-aggressive notes to each other
neon runs the messages since they both tip like crazy just to scoot across town at top speed with bits o paper (and sometimes a small package) and she's already running, so why not? free cash heck yeah
sometimes she peeks at the messages and it's a mixed bag, one day it'll be bickering about the merits of supporting local economies as opposed to global interconnection and another day it'll be 'hey man. 
who do u think the hottest person in town is. i wont tell xoxo' 
and another day it'll be petty nonsense like 'did you enjoy the sweet melons in summer, which you can't get anywhere else just as fresh?' / 'how's the exotic spices? i'm sure you've never tasted anything like that in this small town, you know how it is'




KAYO
nanobomb +kayo stay in the carpentry/lab house
viper and reyna cohabitate and have an ArrangementTM, but viper might also have a spare room for overnight lab work
(this is where chamber's stuff ends up, because even he would not tempt fate so much as to do Things in reyna's territory)

maybe occasionally there can be a tech meetup
