# Stardew Valley Valorant Mod

A Valorant x Stardew Valley mod

And yes, this was done out of a [Yokye post](https://twitter.com/Spliinkles/status/1506364380245794817?s=20&t=BjnXHAs0HTVpaVORa6S-BA), so expect the best story there

This will be used as somewhat of a list of what changes have been done. For help with installing mods in the first place please check out places like [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started). In case of issues, either make a post here on github or write the team on discord (e.g. splitted_spark). 

This is our first mod and thus there will be more and more changes added but for now no major map reworks are in planning. This mod is in English! No language adaptations are planned.
First will be a list of the overall planned changes to the game and after that will be the version updates:

Characters
---
On the left the original character, on the right the changed character. 
Be careful of spoilers! POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD!
If marked by "\*\*\*\*" no certain NPC has been selected to be changed into. 
A "\*" before original character means that they are potential marriage characters(in the basegame). May be changed at a later date. 
Scratch that, they will be changed later, cause the family relations otherwise will make no sense.
