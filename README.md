# Stardew Valley Valorant Mod

A Valorant x Stardew Valley mod

And yes, this was done out of a Yokye post, so expect the best story there

This will be used as somewhat of a list of what changes have been done. I will not be explaining how
to install mods. If you find any trouble with the mod and its content: Write me on Discord
@Splitted_Spark#0136

This is my first mod and thus there will be more and more changes added but for now no major map reworks are in planning
First will be a list of the overall planned changes to the game and after that will be the version updates:
One last thing: I am terrible at art, pixelart as well. So a huge thanks goes to the contributors:
- Flare: art, code
- TheWinner: code
- Spliinkles: ideas and decision-making help
- ...

and more who helped this journey. Enjoy!


Characters
---
On the left the original character, on the right the changed character. 
Be careful of spoilers! POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD!
If marked by "****" no certain NPC has been selected to be changed into. 
A "*" before original character means that they are potential marriage characters(in the basegame). May be changed at a later date. 
Scratch that, they will be changed later, cause the family relations otherwise will make no sense.
